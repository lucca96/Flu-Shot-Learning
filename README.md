# Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccination - Data Science Competition

## Overview

Welcome to the Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccination competition! The challenge is to predict whether people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using information they shared about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors. This competition is a fantastic opportunity to delve into the world of data science and explore the factors influencing vaccination patterns.

## Background

Vaccination is a crucial public health measure, providing immunization for individuals and contributing to community-wide protection through "herd immunity." This competition focuses on the public health response to the H1N1 influenza virus, which caused a global pandemic in 2009, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.

The dataset for this competition comes from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey conducted in the United States. Participants were surveyed about their vaccination status for H1N1 and seasonal flu, along with questions covering their social, economic, and demographic background, opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness, and behaviors towards mitigating transmission.

## Data Source

The dataset is provided courtesy of the United States National Center for Health Statistics.

## Note

This competition is for learning and exploring, and the deadline may be extended in the future. We encourage you to join and contribute to a better understanding of vaccination patterns for future public health efforts.

Happy coding, and good luck with your predictions!
